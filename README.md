# HubAllocation Application
This application allows users to apply clustering algorithms such as k-means, 
affinity propagation, mean-shift, spectral clustering, hierarchical clustering, and 
DBSCAN to points read from a text file. Afterwards, heuristic functions like hill 
climbing and simulated annealing can be used to optimize the results obtained 
from these algorithms. Users are prompted to enter specific parameters for each 
function. The outputs can be obtained in .txt and .jpeg formats

# Running the program

 Download the project file. 
 
• Open the HubAllAPP file.

• Run the HubAllAPP.py file, with double click or from command window 

As:

```python
cd HubAllAPP
python HubAllAPP.py 
```

After clicking the "Open Source" button, the user can select an text file in either 
.txt format. Then, the user can choose whichever function they desire. After the processing is done, you can obtain status information in the bottom-left 
corner. The "info" section displays information related to the executed function. 
In the "results" section, cluster labels, cluster centers, and objective function 
results are printed as output.
When heuristic functions are used, it enters a loop to find the most optimized 
result possible. In the bottom-left corner, a text message containing information 
about the process is displayed. Once the process is complete, it presents the 
lowest objective function value obtained in a window to the user.
